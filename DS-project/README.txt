Overview:
For our project we chose Binary Search Tree(BST) as our data structure as the main focus of our project
was on searching records and BST has average time complexity O(log n) and worst case O(n) for search, delete
and insert operations. For searching records we have also used Trie data structure to search by name.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The MAIN function:
  The main function automatically calls the --Records()-- function each time on startup which inserts the data
  in a Binary Search Tree from our database file "Records.txt" which consists of existing records.
  Then the --Start()-- function is called which provides the following options:
  Enter the number to execute the function
      Function                  Description
  1-  AddRecords()            To add new record
  2-  PrintRecords()          To print all the existing records
  3-  Search()                To search records
  4-  delete()                To delete defaulter records
  5-  getDate()               To generate defaulter automatic message

    3.1.void Search(BST *list)
    3.1.1. int checkValidity(char number[]):
          Taking an input from the user and checking whether that input is a valid mobile number or not by calling a function checkValidity which internally calls another function isChar.
	         ->checkValidity function returns 1 if the mobile number is an invalid number and 0 otherwise.
	          ->If the mobile number is an invalid number then it prompts the user 2 times to enter a valid mobile number.
	           ->If the user enters an invalid mobile number 3 times then he can't access the database.
	            ->If the mobile number entered by the user is a valid one then we call a function Search.
    3.1.2. Search function performs the following tasks:
	           ->checks whether the mobile number is there in the database or not.
	            ->If it is there in the database then it prints the details of the customer corresponding to that mobile number.



(2)  ->PRINTING ALL THE NAMES BEGINING WITH A PREFIX:
        SEARCHING ALL THE NAMES BEGINING WITH A PARTICULAR PREFIX AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY PRINTING THEM USING TRIE DATA STRUCTURE.

    		->checks if the space allocation was successfull or not
    		->If the allocation was successfull:
    			->initialising all the character pointers of the character pointer array as null
    		->returns the head of the trie

	3.2.3. int C2I(char ch)
          A function C2I which does the following tasks:
        		->Converts a character to an integer by converting:
        		->lower-case alphabets to integers in the inclusive range of 0-25

                Inserting a node into the trie data structure using the insertTrie function which performs the following task:
		            ->inserts a name to the trie data structure

	3.2.5. Taking an input from the user which serves as our prefix, corresponding to which we have to print all the names to which that prefix is common.
            		->Firstly we call a function search which searches whether that prefix is there in the trie data structure or not
            		->If it is there in the trie data structure then we call another function.i.e.,t.

	3.2.6. Function t performs the following tasks:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)  void getDate(BST *list)-
The function ____getDate():
 Checks who all are in the defaulter's(didn't used from last two months) list :
  ->In this function we have to go to each note of the BST and
  ->check the date between present date and last used date by the function ___check_date():

      4.1. int check_date(BST *list)
                  ->check_date calculates number of days between Last Use date and present Date
                  ->This function calls function ___days() to calculate number of days between Last Use and Present Days

      4.2. int days(int y1,int y2,int m1,int m2,int d1,int d2)
                        This function calculates the number of days between two dates. Say the date D1 is older than D2.
                        Then we initially take all the days of the year in D1 and add all the days of the years in between.
                        We have till now not added the number of days in the year of D2. Now we subtract the extra days added
                        (When we took all days of year(D1)) and add the left over days of D2.
                        Both of these are done using function ____month()

                        ->This function accepts the month and year as input and returns the total number of days starting
                        from January till the end of that month .And returns the number of days

5.2. int days(int d1,int d2,int m1,int m2,int y1,int y2):
          This function calculates the number of days betweentwo dates. Say the date D1 is older than D2.
          Then we initially take all the days of the year in D1 and add all the days of the years in between.
          We have till now not added the number of days in the year of D2. Now we subtract the extra days added
          (When we took all days of year(D1)) and add the left over days of D2.
          Both of these are done using --month()--function

5.3. BST* traverse(BST *root,BST *parent):
        This function takes two args- root and parent, both of which are initially the same. root changes each
        time in recursive call and acts like current node.The parent is always the parent of the current node
        Finally, this function returns the address of the LAST NODE of the binary search tree.
        At the same time its address in the parent is made NULL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.5. void deleteNode(BST *root,BST *node):
          This function uses the traverse and overwrite function to delete a node from a Binary Search Tree.
          It performs the following:
          ->Find the last node of tree
          ->Overwrite the node to be deleted with the last node
          ->free the last node
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
4.7. void preorder(BST *root,BST *head):
            This function simply performs the preorder traversal(left,root,right) of tree and calls the
            --deleteNodeIfTrue()--function to check if the node has to be deleted or not
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
5.8. void inorder(FILE *f,BST *root):
            This function accepts the records file address and root of BinarySearchTree and rewrites the whole data of
